# App Description #
This app is designed to act as a personality test that will place you in a House at Hogwarts based on the answers that you select.

Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder:
Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff.

Gryffindor values courage, bravery, nerve, and chivalry. Gryffindor's mascot is the lion, and its colors are scarlet and gold.

Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black are its colors.

Ravenclaw values intelligence, creativity, learning, and wit.The house mascot is an eagle and the house colors are blue and grey.

Slytherin values ambition, cunning, leadership, resourcefulness, and will do anything to get their way. The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colors are green and silver.


Once you are placed into a House, you will have the option to do the quiz again and try to be placed into another house. You can also view the results of the quiz and what houses you were placed in, as well as delete any of the results that you did not like.

Finally, you are able to view a list of the students in each respective House, yourself included.
